## Idea for CodeFunDo
In the scenario of India elections, one of the most common problem hampering the fair electoral process is the issue of fake voting and proxy voting inconsistency. There are multiple attempts by the Election commision and various authorities to minimize such happens, but are unable to eleminate it at the last mile.

## Description of Problem
### Proxy Voting
This is the process where the government permits personell who cannot attend the electoral process can authorize someone else to vote on their behalf. This specific system is exploited by many parties by producing fake certicificats claiming the same.
### Fake Voting
This is the factor that hugely impacts the election results. According to unofficial surveys, 1.25 lakh to 1.5 lakh bogus voters are present in every Parliamentary constituency. This is done in many ways, as described below:
- Fake Citizen certificates: Fake citizens along with forged proof and citizenship documents are raised and then people are made to vote with those election IDs
- Dead Citizens not registered: Citizens who have expired don't have any reporting mechanism to the election authorities. So polotical parties use this loophole in the system to fake vote on their behalf.
Now these only few of the many such issues. And although there have been attempts to better this, the parties and bogus/corrupt parties and politicians always find a way out, and this is normally by tampering official records of citizens in various places.

## Proposal
The use of blockchain has mainly improved on two things: reliability of data, and prevent the accumulation of power in the hands of few. Thus, Blockchain makes for the most sensible solution to the above mentioned problem. Harnessing the power of blockchain technologies, we can make sure that if we have an initially reliable record of citizen data, it can be made tamperproof.
Now, for the second part of the problem, i.e., collection of reliable data. Now, who better a person to tell about whether a citizen is going to vote or not, or if he/she is living and in a state to do so? It's obviously the person themselves or their kin. And so we can create a system to recieve data directly from the citizens.

Thus, I propose to work on a Website which is cross platform, stable and secure with a light internet footprint, thus making it accessible and easy to use even in the most remote of locations with access to basic network facilities. And if someone does not have internet access, we can set up a system where citizens can use features like SMS to register if they aren't going to vote.
Further we store the data using distributed blockchain technolgies to make sure the data does not fall into the wrong hands and is tamperproof. This data when provided to the election commission before the elections, and with raised awareness and active participation from the common man will definetely minimize, if not eleminate just yet, this whole scam of fake and proxy voting.
